MIDI-MUG is an Open-Source JavaFX application that aims to help practice piano with 150+ instruments built-in.

This application required an external MIDI Piano keyboard for input and show each note in the music sheet as a bar according to the length and pitch.

There are several modes, perform, practice, and standalone only.

With perform mode, the application shows the user how to play the song.

With practice mode, the application makes hints to help the user learn to play the song.

With standalone mode, the user plays the song by himself, just like with regular instruments.
